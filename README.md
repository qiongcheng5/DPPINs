# DPPINs_Vital_Nodes

In this project, we developed an original ensemble learning and analysis framework to help detect the critical state during disease development as well as the associated temporal biomarkers, which are very challenging but meaningful for designing an appropriate intervention to prevent the deterioration.  

In this innovative framework, we used thermodynamic modeling and relative entropy methods to identify and verify the critical state transition; we build ensemble learning to predict temporal gene expression profiles, constructed time-evolving tissue-specific dynamical protein-protein interaction networks, and define an ensemble scoring schema to identify vital protein nodes on each temporal protein network near critical states of disease development. These temporal vital proteins are enriched in pathway analysis.
